# n8n Frontend Project Description

**Author:** Project Documentation
**Date:** November 26, 2023

## Project Overview

The n8n Frontend is a modern web application built using React and TypeScript that provides a visual workflow editor for AI and data processing tasks. The application allows users to create, configure, and execute workflows by connecting different types of nodes in a visual graph interface.

## Key Features

### Visual Flow Editor

-   Interactive node-based workflow editor using ReactFlow
-   Drag and drop interface for adding new nodes
-   Custom edge connections between nodes
-   Snap-to-grid functionality for precise node placement
-   Collapsible sidebar for node selection

### Node Types

The application supports several specialized node types:

-   **Prompt Node**: Input node for user prompts
-   **Agent Node**: Processing node with customizable options
-   **LLM Node**: Language Model integration node
-   **Memory Node**: State management node
-   **Vector Database Node**: Document storage and retrieval node
-   **Output Node**: Results display node

### Interactive Features

-   Modal dialogs for node configuration
-   Draggable and resizable UI components
-   Real-time workflow execution
-   Run/Stop controls for workflow execution
-   Chatbot interface for interaction

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

-   React.js with TypeScript
-   Vite as build tool
-   `@xyflow/react` for flow visualization
-   `ReactMarkdown` for markdown rendering
-   `KaTeX` for mathematical expressions

### Key Components

#### App Component

The main application component manages:

-   Workflow state management
-   Node and edge handling
-   Server communication
-   UI state management

#### ChatbotBar Component

A dedicated chat interface that provides:

-   Real-time communication
-   Message history
-   Markdown rendering support
-   Expandable/collapsible interface

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with a backend service through RESTful API endpoints:

-   Workflow execution endpoint
-   File upload for Vector Database
-   Real-time status updates

## Deployment

The application is deployed using:

-   GitHub Pages for hosting
-   Continuous deployment through GitHub Actions
-   Vite build system for production optimization

## UI/UX Features

### Responsive Design

-   Adaptive layout
-   Responsive modals
-   Dynamic sidebar
-   Custom scrollbars

### Interactive Elements

-   Drag and drop functionality
-   Real-time feedback
-   Loading states
-   Error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

-   Workflow templates
-   Node grouping
-   Undo/redo functionality
-   Workflow export/import
-   Additional node types
-   Enhanced error handling
-   Performance optimizations
